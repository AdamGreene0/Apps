5. Isosceles triangle

5d. Isosceles triangle - An isosceles triangle is a triangle in which two sides are of equal length. The angles opposite to the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal.

5f. Perimeter of an isosceles triangle = (P) = 2a + b
where, a = the length of the equal sides; b = the length of the base (unequal side)

5f. Area of isosceles triangle formula - Area = ¬Ω √ó base √ó Height

Ffa. Height of an isosceles triangle formula = To find the height of an isosceles triangle, use the Pythagorean theorem: h = ‚àö(a¬≤ - (b/2)¬≤) where "a" is the length of one of the equal sides and "b" is the length of the base; essentially, you square the length of one equal side, subtract the square of half the base, and then take the square root of the result.
