0.f. Circumference formula = circumference=2 x pi x radius

0. Circle definition 
circle is a two-dimensional, closed, curved shape with no corners or edges. It's made up of all points in a plane that are the same distance from a central point. The distance between a circle's center and any point on the circle is called the radius. A line segment that passes through the center and connects two points on the circle is called the diameter. Circles are fundamental shapes found in everything from atoms to stars. 

1. Circle area. D + f
Area of a circle definition 🏩0✅ all the area it takes up 

The area of a circle is the two-dimensional space it occupies and can be calculated using the formula A = πr², where r is the circle's radius. The area is represented in square units, like cm² or m². π is a Greek letter representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, with an approximate value of 3.14159. The formula can also be written as A = πd²/4, where d is the circle's diameter.

7a. Unit circle definition = unit circle is a mathematical tool that simplifies the use of trigonometric functions and angles. It's a circle on the Cartesian plane with a radius of exactly one unit, centered at the origin (0, 0). The equation for a unit circle is x² + y² = 1. The unit circle is also known as the trig circle. It's useful for visualizing the coordinates of a circle on a graph and for solving trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.
